This is a series of python modules that provide multi-dimensional curve fitting using least square method.

The point of this project is to experiment with random functions, residuals and non-parametric methods of estimating the correctness of the solution.

It currently includes a small set of functions and residuals, but it's extensible. It also provides two different bootstrapping methods, with more to come.

Dependencies: PyQt4, SciPy, Matplotib (pylab)

Optional dependencies: Cython

On Linux, these are all easy to get from your favorite distribution

On Windows, I recommend installing Python(x,y) as it will contain all you need

On Mac OS X, go on the respective websites, and install the packages. You might also want to use something like MacPort
